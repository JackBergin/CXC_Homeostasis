# Govee_Data_Parsing-Plotting

## Purpose Statement
This repository will have the ability to parse through and connect dyson air purifiers and govee temp modules to a centralized python script. From there it will parse through the govee temp module data and format it for graphing. This script will also connect to the dyson air purifiers and allow for the dysons and the govee modules to be connected to a thingworx dashboard. From there, an AR experience can be made in the space that will showcase maitenence on the air purifiers along with the digital thread message. 

## Old intent of repository
This repository will be responsible for taking the exported datasets govee outputs and converts them into plots after running a desired matlab script. The hope is to automate the entirety of the process using a .sh file.
